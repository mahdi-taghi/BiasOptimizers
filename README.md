# Damage Prediction and Traction-Separation Analysis

## Overview
This project involves:
- Generating a dataset to simulate damage and traction-separation behavior using mathematical models.
- Visualizing traction-separation laws and damage-separation relationships.
- Implementing and training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for damage prediction.
- Evaluating model performance and visualizing results.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `tensorflow`

### Installation
